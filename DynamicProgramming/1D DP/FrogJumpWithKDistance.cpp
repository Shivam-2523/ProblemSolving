/*
Given an array arr[] of size n, where arr[i] denotes the height of ith stone. Geek starts from stone 0 and from stone i, he can jump to stones i + 1, i + 2, … i + k. The cost for jumping from stone i to stone j is abs(arr[i] – arr[j]). Find the minimum cost for Geek to reach the last stone.

Example:

Input: k = 3, arr[]= [10, 30, 40, 50, 20]
Output: 30
Explanation: Geek will follow the path 1->2->5, the total cost would be |10-30| + |30-20| = 30, which is minimum.
Input: k = 1, arr[]= [10, 20, 10]
Output: 20
Explanation: Geek will follow the path 1->2->3, the total cost would be |10 - 20| + |20 - 10| = 20.
Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <=104
1 <= k <= 100
1 <= arr[i] <= 104
